Description: Reads and fragments aligned to splice junctions can be used to
    quantify alternative splicing events (ASE). However, overlapping ASEs can
	confound their quantification. SpliceWiz quantifies ASEs, calculating
	percent-spliced-in (PSI) using junction reads, and intron retention using
	IRFinder-based quantitation. Novel filters identify ASEs that are relatively
	less confounded by overlapping events, whereby PSIs can be calculated with
	higher confidence. SpliceWiz is ultra-fast, using multi-threaded processing
	of BAM files. It can be run using a graphical user or command line 
	interfaces. GUI-based interactive visualization of differential ASEs,
	including novel group-based RNA-seq coverage visualization, simplifies
	short-read RNA-seq analysis in R.
