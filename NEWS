Changes in version 0.99.4 (2022-10-19)
+ New feature: plotCoverage now implements junction counts (sashimi plot style).
Currently it is only implemented for plotting tracks of individual samples
+ NxtSE object now has 3 getter functions junc_PSI(), junc_counts() and
junc_gr() for getting (prelim) PSIs, counts and GRanges of junction counts.
The first two are DelayedMatrices linked using the makeSE() function. These
matrices are never subsetted by row but only by column. Furthermore, they are
only realized as on-memory matrices upon calling realize_NxtSE() and setting
`includeJunctions = TRUE`
+ Bugfix: ASE_DESeq2: previously, inclusion / exclusion counts were normalised
prior to differential analysis using DESeq2. This is now fixed by specifying
sizefilters() <- 1
+ Bugfix: NMD data for introns - some 3'-UTR introns were mislabeled as CDS 
introns - now fixed
+ BUGFIX: fixed errors in ALE reference generation for novel reference

Changes in version 0.99.3 (2022-08-24)
+ Added support for novel splicing
  + This includes modifying the buildRef and (C++-internal) processBAM functions
  to annotate and count tandem junctions, and collateData function to compile
  SpliceWiz novel-ASE reference on-the-fly 
+ Added getter functions to view the SpliceWiz reference
+ Other misc bug fixes

Changes in version 0.99.2 (2022-07-23)
+ Added wrapper functions to use the STAR aligner to process fastq files
+ Added "SpliceWiz cookbook" vignette to illustrate functions involving
"real world" genomes / transcriptomes
+ Fixed bug that triggers error in ASE_limma() when two genes with different
gene_id have the same gene_name in the annotation. References built from prior
versions of SpliceWiz are not supported!
+ Bugfix for translating protein codons when source genome contains N's

Changes in version 0.99.0 (2022-06-02)
