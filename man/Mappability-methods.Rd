\usage{
generateSyntheticReads(
  reference_path,
  read_len = 70,
  read_stride = 10,
  error_pos = 35,
  verbose = TRUE,
  alt_fasta_file
)

)
}
\arguments{
\item{reference_path}{The directory of the reference prepared by
\link{getResources}}

\item{read_len}{The nucleotide length of the synthetic reads}

\item{read_stride}{The nucleotide distance between adjacent synthetic reads}

\item{error_pos}{The position of the procedurally-generated nucleotide error
from the start of each synthetic reads}

\item{verbose}{Whether additional status messages are shown}

\item{alt_fasta_file}{(Optional) The path to the user-supplied genome fasta
file, if different to that found inside the \code{resource} subdirectory of the
\code{reference_path}. If \link{getResources} has already been run,
this parameter should be omitted.}

\item{aligned_bam}{The BAM file of alignment of the synthetic reads generated
by \code{generateSyntheticReads()}. Users should use a genome splice-aware
aligner, preferably the same aligner used to align the samples in their
experiment.}

\item{threshold}{Genomic regions with this alignment read depth (or below)
in the aligned synthetic read BAM are defined as low
mappability regions.}

\item{n_threads}{The number of threads used to calculate mappability
exclusion regions from aligned bam file of synthetic reads.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
\item For \code{generateSyntheticReads}: writes \code{Reads.fa} to the \code{Mappability}
subdirectory inside the given \code{reference_path}.
\item For \code{calculateMappability}: writes a gzipped BED file
named \code{MappabilityExclusion.bed.gz} to the \code{Mappability} subdirectory
inside \code{reference_path}.
This BED file is automatically used by \link{buildRef} if its
\code{MappabilityRef} parameter is not specified.
}
}
\description{
These functions empirically calculate low-mappability (Mappability Exclusion)
regions using the given reference. A splice-aware alignment software
capable of aligning reads to the genome is required.
See details and examples below.
}
\details{
Creating a Mappability Exclusion BED file is a three-step process.
\cr
\itemize{
\item First, using \code{generateSyntheticReads()}, synthetic reads are systematically
generated using the given genome contained within \code{reference_path}, prepared
via \link{getResources}. Alternatively, use \code{alt_fasta_file} to set the genome
sequence if this is different to that prepared by \code{getResources} or if
\code{getResources} is not yet run.
\item Second, an aligner such as STAR (preferably the same aligner used for the
subsequent RNA-seq experiment) is required to align these reads to the source
genome. Poorly mapped regions of the genome will be reflected by regions of
low coverage depth.
\item Finally, the BAM file containing the aligned reads is analysed
using \code{calculateMappability()}, to identify
low-mappability regions to compile the Mappability Exclusion BED file.
}

It is recommended to leave all parameters to their default settings. Regular
users should only specify \code{reference_path}, \code{aligned_bam} and \code{n_threads},
as required.

NB: \link{STAR_mappability} runs all 3 steps required, using the \code{STAR} aligner.
This only works in systems where \code{STAR} is installed.

NB2: \link{buildFullRef} builds the STAR reference, then calculates mappability.
It then uses the calculated mappability regions to build the SpliceWiz
reference.

NB3: In systems where \code{STAR} is not available, consider using HISAT2 or
Rsubread. A working example using Rsubread is shown below.
