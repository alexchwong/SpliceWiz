# NxtSE Class functions

#' The NxtSE class
#'
#' The NxtSE class inherits from the \linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment} 
#' class and is constructed from [MakeSE]. NxtSE extends SummarizedExperiment
#' by housing additional assays pertaining to IR and splice junction counts.
#' @param x A NxtSE object
#' @param i,j Row and column subscripts to subset a NxtSE object.
#' @param ... In NxtSE(), additional arguments to be passed onto
#'   SummarizedExperiment()
#' @param withDimnames (default TRUE) Whether exported assays should be
#'   supplied with row and column names of the NxtSE object.
#'   See \linkS4class{SummarizedExperiment}
#' @param deparse.level See [base::cbind] for a description of this argument.
#' @param drop A logical(1), ignored by these methods.
#' @param value The value to replace. Must be a matrix for the 
#'   up_inc<-, down_inc<-, up_exc<- and down_exc<- replacers, 
#'   and a character vector for covfile<-
#' @return See Functions section (below) for details

#' NxtIRF filters to remove low-abundance alternative splicing and intron
#' retention events
#'
#' @param filterClass Must be either `"Data"` or `"Annotation"`. See details
#' @param filterType If `filterClass = "Data"`, then must be one of 
#'   `c("Depth", "Coverage", "Consistency")`. If `filterClass = "Annotation"`,
#'   must be one of `c("Protein_Coding", "NMD", "TSL")`. See details
#' @param pcTRUE If conditions are set, what percentage of all samples in each
#'   of the condition must the filter be satisfied for the event to pass the
#'   filter check. Must be between 0 and 100 (default 100)
#' @param minimum Filter-dependent argument. See details
#' @param maximum Filter-dependent argument. See details
#' @param minDepth Filter-dependent argument. See details
#' @param condition (default "") If set, must match the name of an experimental
#'   condition in the NxtSE object to be filtered, 
#'   i.e. a column name in `colData(se)`. Leave blank to disable filtering
#'   by condition
#' @param minCond (default -1) If condition is set, how many minimum number of
#'   conditions must pass the filter criteria. For example,
#'   if condition = "Batch", and batches are "A", "B", or "C", setting
#'   `minCond = 2` with `pcTRUE = 100` means that all samples belonging to
#'   two of the three types of `Batch` must pass the filter criteria.
#'   Setting `-1` means all elements of `condition` must
#'   pass criteria. Set to `-1` when the number of elements in the experimental
#'   condition is unknown. Ignored if `condition` is left blank.
#' @param EventTypes What types of events are considered for filtering. Must be 
#'   one of `c("IR", "MXE", "SE", "A3SS", "A5SS", "AFE", "ALE", "RI")`. Events 
#'   not specified in `EventTypes` are not filtered (i.e. they will pass the
#'   filter without checks)
#' @details
#'   **Annotation Filters**
#'   * **Protein_Coding**: Filters for alternative splicing or IR events 
#'       involving protein-coding transcripts.
#'       No additional parameters required.
#'   * **NMD**: Filters for events in which one isoform is a
#'       predicted NMD substrate.
#'   * **TSL**: filters for events in which both
#'       isoforms have a TSL level below or equal to `minimum`
#'   * **Terminus** (New as of version 1.1.1): 
#'       In alternate first exons, the splice junction must
#'       not be shared with another transcript for which it is not its first
#'       intron. For alternative last exons, the splice junction must not be
#'       shared with another transcript for which it is not its last intron
#'   * **ExclusiveMXE** (New as of version 1.1.1):
#'       For MXE events, the two alternate
#'       casette exons must not overlap in their genomic regions
#'
#'   **Data Filters**
#'   * **Depth**: Filters IR or alternative splicing events of transcripts
#'       that are "expressed" with adequate `Depth` as calculated by the
#'       sum of all splicing and IR reads spanning the event. Events with 
#'       `Depth` below `minimum` are filtered out
#'   * **Coverage**: Coverage means different things to IR and alternative
#'       splicing.\cr\cr
#'     For **IR**, Coverage refers to the percentage of the measured intron
#'       covered with reads. Introns of samples with an IntronDepth above 
#'       `minDepth` are assessed, with introns with coverage 
#'       below `minimum` are filtered out.\cr\cr
#'     For **Alternative Splicing**, Coverage refers to the percentage of all
#'       splicing events observed across the genomic region that is compatible
#'       with either the included or excluded event. This prevents NxtIRF from 
#'       doing differential analysis between two minor isoforms. Instead of
#'       IntronDepth, in AS events NxtIRF considers events where the spliced
#'       reads from both exonic regions exceed `minDepth`.
#'       Then, events with a splicing coverage below `minimum`
#'       are excluded. \cr\cr
#'       We recommend testing IR events for > 90% coverage and AS
#'       events for > 60% coverage as given in the default filters which can be
#'       accessed using [get_default_filters]\cr\cr
#'    * **Consistency**: Skipped exons (SE) and mutually exclusive exons
#'       (MXE) comprise reads aligned to two contiguous splice junctions. 
#'       Most algorithms take the average counts from both junctions. This
#'       will inadvertently include transcripts that share one but not both
#'       splice events. To check that this is not happening, we require both
#'       splice junctions to have comparable counts.
#'       This filter checks whether reads from each splice junction comprises
#'       a reasonable proportion of the sum of these reads.\cr\cr
#'     Events are excluded if either of the upstream or downstream
#'       event is lower than total splicing events by a log-2 magnitude 
#'       above `maximum`. For example, if 
#'       `maximum = 2`, we require both upstream and downstream
#'       events to represent at least 1/(2^2) = 1/4 of the sum of upstream
#'       and downstream event. If `maximum = 3`, then each junction must be at
#'       least 1/8 of total, etc.
#'       This is considered for each isoform of each event, as long as the
#'       total counts belonging to the considered isoform is above 
#'       `minDepth`.\cr\cr
#'     IR-events are also checked. For IR events, the upstream and downstream
#'     exon-intron spanning reads must comprise a reasonable proportion of total
#'     exon-intron spanning reads.
#'
#'   We highly recommend using the default filters, which can be acquired 
#'     using [get_default_filters]
